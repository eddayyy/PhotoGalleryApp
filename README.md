1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - Use the command `git clone https://github.com/eddayyy/PhotoGalleryApp` to clone the repository.

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   # Install virtualenv if not installed
   pip install virtualenv

   # Create a virtual environment
   virtualenv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On MacOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**

   Install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Set up the Front End**

   Install ReactJS and navigate to /photogallery and in your terminal type:

   ```bash
   npm install # to install the dependencies
   ```

   Afterwards, in your terminal type:

   ```bash
   npm start # start the front end server
